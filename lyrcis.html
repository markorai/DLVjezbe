        You get a shiver in the dark
        It's raining in the park but meantime
        South of the river you stop and you hold everything
        A band is blowing Dixie double four time
        You feel alright when you hear that music ring

        You step inside but you don't see too many faces
        Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
        Too much competition too many other places
        But not too many horns can make that sound
        Way on downsouth way on downsouth London town

        You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
        Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
        And an old guitar is all he can afford
        When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

        And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
        He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
        He can play honky tonk just like anything
        Saving it up for Friday night
        With the Sultans
        With the Sultans of Swing

        And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
        Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
        The don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
        It ain't what they call rock and roll
        And the Sultans played Creole

        And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
        And says at last just as the time bell rings
        'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'
        And he makes it fast whith one more thing
        'We are the Sultans of Swing'
